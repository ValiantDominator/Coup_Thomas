# Note: this is the final practice in the coup class. Be ready for the arena
# next class



# Problem 1
# Prepare your agent to the maximum effectiveness to duel against other coup
# agents in the arena
### THE RULES
"""
-   Your Coup Agent must follow the Coup Agent guidelines in the README.md on
    the github
-   Every feasible duel that *can* take place *will* take place. Each duel
    will take place in *my* Arena.py. 1000 games will be played. For you to
    be declared a "winner", you must win 550 or more of those 1000 games.
    -   All students will duel Beef, Markus, and Abe
    -   All students will duel each other student
-   After that, 1000 games will take place in a FFA manner with each student's
    bot in the running. The winner is simply the agent who wins the most games.

## Suggestions
# Make multiple agents and have your champion perform okay against all of them
# Remember: for each strategy you can code, there is *almost certainly* another
#           strategy which beats it. The price of beating specific oppoents,
#           however, is losing on the general scale.
