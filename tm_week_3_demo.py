# Preliminaries
    # Push to github! Otherwise I can't even see what you've tried
    # It's good practice to push your code to github every time you stop coding
        # Even if you're not done yet!
    # Practice 2
        # I notice that I'm the author of a lot of your code,
        # please change that so you can preserve a shareable deliverable
    # Don't know coup?

# Go to https://github.com/DSMishler/Coup_Instructor and follow along

# We made it here. Here's what we know:
    # variables
    # conditionals
    # files
    # lists
    # functions
    # classes
# How do we build coup?
    # Defensive programming





"""
It is crucial that you follow the conventions of the game file so that your
coup agents can play with other hosts
